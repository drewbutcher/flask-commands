def view_make_file(destination_file_path: str) -> tuple[ScaffoldStatus, str]:
    """
    Create a new Jinja view extending the generated base template and containing
    a randomly selected, Python-themed quote.

    The function places the selected quote inside the template's content block
    and writes it to the given destination path using `file_write_file`. If a
    file already exists at that path, a styled warning message is returned
    instead of overwriting the file. Any other unexpected exceptions are also
    caught and returned as a styled error message.

    Args:
        destination_file_path (str) : The full path (including filename) where
        the view file should be created.

    Returns:
        tuple[ScaffoldStatus, str]: A tuple containing:
            - ScaffoldStatus.ADDED when the view was created
            - ScaffoldStatus.EXISTS when the file already exists
            - ScaffoldStatus.ERROR on unexpected failure
            - str: A formatted message with success/warning/error notification and usage instructions.

    Examples:
        >>> status, message = view_make_file("app/templates/posts/index.html")
        >>> status in [ScaffoldStatus.ADDED, ScaffoldStatus.EXISTS, ScaffoldStatus.ERROR]
        True

    Notes:
        Existing view files are never overwritten by this function.
