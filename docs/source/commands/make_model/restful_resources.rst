RESTful Resource with make:model --crud
=======================================

Creating the model structure in an application is only the first step when
building out a full application or application feature.

In the last section, we created a ``Recipe`` model, again 🫩.  This time,
however, we just focused on the model-only flow:

- creating the model with ``flask make:model``,
- migrating the database with ``flask db migrate -m 'message'`` and
  ``flask db upgrade``,
- testing the model in ``flask shell``.

This is a great workflow when you are testing out a new data structure.
However, most resources need more than a model. For example, a recipe will
need a controller, routes, and templates so people can work with it in the
browser.

Otherwise, the model is shouting with a megaphone 📣 saying, "Hey, is there
anyone out there? I'm ready to CRUD."  That is why I decided to bring back
our controller option ``--crud`` in this new ``make:model`` section.

Build a Resource with  ``make:model`` & ``--crud``
--------------------------------------------------

.. youtube_embed:: build-a-resource-with-make-model-and-crud

In the event that you want to build a new model structure and you already know
that you are going to need the full RESTful resource structure, you can just
add one optional flag to get everything built out at once.

.. admonition:: Before you run this

   If you are following along from earlier chapters, there is a
   good chance that you already have a ``Recipe`` model in your project.

   To avoid warnings and to see the creation output from start to finish, please
   spin up a fresh app with something like

   .. code-block:: bash

      flask new example_model_with_crud

By adding ``--crud`` to our prior make command we end up with so much
more than just a single model file.

Let's try it out with the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   flask make:model Recipe --crud

For me, this is the natural way I think about these structures, and from this
one short command I end up with the following structure:

- a ``Recipe`` model
- model registration in ``app/models/__init__.py``
- a ``RecipeController``
- controller registration in ``app/controllers/__init__.py``
- seven RESTful controller actions
- RESTful routes for ``recipes``
- blueprint registration for the new route directory
- templates for the ``GET`` actions

That is a lot of typing you did not have to type. I am personally a big fan of
not typing the same boilerplate seven times while pretending I am having fun.

If you have been following along, this will look familiar.  You have actually
already seen a command in the make controller chapters that built out these
exact same files with this exact same structure:

.. code-block:: bash

   flask make:controller RecipeController --crud -m

The difference is not the destination. The difference is where you mentally
start.

With ``make:controller``, you start thinking from the mechanics of the object
(controller name) and ask Flask-Commands to generate the model from it.

With ``make:model``, you start thinking from the object (model name) and ask
Flask-Commands to build the RESTful structure around it.

Neither one is more correct. They are just different doors into the same house.
And yes, I would absolutely rather have multiple doors 🚪 than crawl through a
window 🪟 like a stressed-out raccoon 🦝. Wait, no. Ignore the raccoon 🤪. The
point is doors are good.

For single-segment resource names like ``Recipe``, both approaches are easy
to read. But as soon as the model name has more than one word or you want
nested resources, the model-first command starts to feel much nicer.
However, similar to ``make:controller``, we can't escape either the prompt or
the need to direct Flask-Commands with an optional ``--flat`` or
``--nest`` flag.  This is where we will pick up in our next chapter
:ref:`Flat vs Nested with make:model<flat-vs-nested-with-make-model>`.
