Model Prompt for make:view
==========================

Now that we have eased into ``flask make:view``, let’s talk about the smarter
side of the command. This is the part that quietly saves you from a lot of
little annoyances before they turn into bigger annoyances 😌

Or in more honest terms, this is where I make some confessions about what
happens behind the scenes.

``flask make:view`` is not just creating a template file and calling it a day.
It is also trying to help when your input is a little messy, when your route
shape is a little unclear, or when you are one missing model away from the
RESTful structure you actually meant to build.

So this chapter is about four things:

- input normalization
- missing-model prompts
- avoiding prompts with flags
- choosing between ``--route``, ``--model``, and ``-m``

Normalize Input Before Scaffolding
----------------------------------

.. youtube_embed:: normalize-input-before-scaffolding

Before we get too deep into the examples, I would like to make some
confessions about what happens behind the scenes with ``flask make:view``.

It’s not that I do not trust that you are going to put in a string that
Flask-Commands cannot handle, right 🤣 Well Oklahoma, the truth is I know
people will put in all kinds of non-standard inputs. So Flask-Commands kind of
normalizes 😇 the dotted input before scaffolding.

That means it will:

- allow upper or lower case anywhere
- allow ``/`` or ``.`` for segment separators
- allow ``-`` or ``_`` for multi-word resources
- collapse repeated separators

So for example:

- ``recipes/comments/index`` becomes ``recipes.comments.index``
- ``shopping-list.index`` becomes ``shopping_list.index``
- ``recipes..comments...index`` becomes ``recipes.comments.index``
- ``Recipes.Comments.Index`` becomes ``recipes.comments.index``

That little bit of cleanup matters because your brain is not always thinking
in the same format every time you type. Sometimes you are thinking in folder
paths. Sometimes you are thinking in dot notation. Sometimes you are just
typing quickly and hoping future-you will forgive present-you 😄

The nice part is that Flask-Commands tries to turn those common variations
into one clean structure before it starts generating files.

Understand Missing-Model Prompts
--------------------------------

.. youtube_embed:: understand-missing-model-prompts

When you use ``-r`` or ``--generate-route`` on a RESTful action,
Flask-Commands looks at the segment immediately before the RESTful action and
checks whether it maps to a registered model.

If you are newer to web development, a **RESTful action** just means a common
page pattern like:

- ``index`` to show many records
- ``show`` to show one record
- ``create`` to show a form for a new record
- ``edit`` to edit an existing record

And when I say **registered model**, I mean a model that already exists in
your app and has been added to ``app/models/__init__.py``.

When Flask-Commands cannot find a registered model for the segment before
a RESTful action, it asks you which route shape you mean.

For example, the command

.. code-block:: console

   flask make:view recipes.index -rc

is going to prompt you like this

.. code-block:: console

   No registered model found for recipes
       - Accept: /recipes
       - Decline: /recipes/index
   Generate the model Recipe?
   [Y/n]:

If you answer yes, Flask-Commands generates ``Recipe`` and uses the more
RESTful route ``/recipes``.

If you answer no, Flask-Commands does not generate a model and falls back to
the more literal route ``/recipes/index``.

One small note before we get into the more detailed examples: throughout this
section I am going to keep using ``-c`` along with route generation.

That is because the missing-model prompt is really about the route shape, not
about choosing a controller. If you leave off ``-c`` and only generate the
route, Flask-Commands will still build the route, but it will default to using
``MainController`` in the route definition.

In other words:

.. code-block:: bash

   flask make:view recipes.index -r

generates a route that returns ``MainController().index()`` which by default
serves your landing page template from ``mains/index.html``.

So throughout this section we will include the controller generator to avoid confusion:

.. code-block:: bash

   flask make:view recipes.index -rc

By using the controller generator flag Flask-Commands generates the
resource-specific controller too, so the route now points to a new controller
method ``RecipeController().index()`` instead.

Let's stay focused on the real question in this chapter: whether the route
should become ``/recipes`` or ``/recipes/index`` when the model does not
exist yet.  In both examples above ``Recipe`` does not exist yet.

The issue here is the generated route.  When you ask Flask-Commands to generate
a route Flask-Commands sees two possible directions for a route:

- if ``Recipe`` is treated like the resource, the route becomes ``/recipes``
- if not, Flask-Commands can fall back to the more literal route ``/recipes/index``

That is why the prompt exists. I figured there is a chance the model needs to
be created for the RESTful action to act upon, or the route you are building
just happens to end in a RESTful action name and you would prefer the literal
word in the URL.

Avoid Prompts with Flags
------------------------

.. youtube_embed:: avoid-prompts-with-flags

If you already know what you want, you do not have to stop for the prompt.

To avoid that prompt, provide one of:

- ``--route`` for an explicit route instead of ``-r``
- ``--model`` for an explicit model
- ``-m`` or ``--generate-model`` to generate the model first

In other words, explicitly state the route or tell Flask-Commands to generate
the model.

If you want the more literal route and do not want to generate a model,
provide the route explicitly:

.. code-block:: bash

   flask make:view recipes.index -c --route /recipes/index

Here Flask-Commands does not need to ask anything because you already told it
the exact route to use.

If you want the more RESTful result, you can either provide the route
explicitly using the RESTful pattern or you can create the model on the fly
when you are building the view.

The explicit RESTful route is similar to the about route without the index:

.. code-block:: bash

   flask make:view recipes.index -c --route /recipes

In both cases above, notice that the model is not created for you because
you have not told Flask-Commands to build a model associated with this route.
However, the prompt was not necessary here because you explicitly told
Flask-Commands the route.

If you want Flask-Commands to also generate a model while you are creating your
RESTful view, you can add on the model information to the above command in one
of two ways.

Either by specifying the model name yourself with ``--model``:


.. code-block:: bash

   flask make:view recipes.index -c --route /recipes --model Recipe

Or you can allow Flask-Commands to generate the name with ``-m``:

.. code-block:: bash

   flask make:view recipes.index --route /recipes -cm

In all the above examples you have avoided the prompt because you have explicitly
defined the route.  If you want Flask-Commands to generate the route with
``-r``, you can still avoid the prompt by creating the model on the fly
as you did above.

Either by giving Flask-Commands the model information up front using ``--model``

.. code-block:: bash

   flask make:view recipes.index -rc --model Recipe

or by using the generator ``-m``.

.. code-block:: bash

   flask make:view recipes.index -rcm

Notice here that the order of ``r``, ``c`` and ``m`` does not matter.

This last form is the shortest way to generate the view, controller, route,
and model.  In this particular case you avoid the prompt by giving full
control over to Flask-Commands to do all the heavy lifting 🏋️‍♀️ and use
generator flags for everything.

As you can see there are several ways to avoid the prompt, but they all follow
the same idea: this prompt only comes into play when you ask for a
generated route on a RESTful action and Flask-Commands still needs a little
more information to know exactly what structure you want.


Choose Between ``--route``, ``--model``, and ``-m``
---------------------------------------------------

.. youtube_embed:: choose-between-route-model-and-m

These options are all helpful, but they help in different ways.

Use ``--route`` when:

- the URL shape is the part you care about most
- you want to say exactly what the route should be
- you do not want route generation deciding that part for you

Use ``--model`` when:

- you know the exact model name
- you want to explicitly connect the view to that model
- you do not want Flask-Commands to do the model naming for you

Use ``-m`` when:

- the model name is already obvious from the view structure
- you want Flask-Commands to generate the model as part of the command flow
- you do not want to repeat yourself more than necessary

Also note you can mix together the ``--route`` with ``--model`` or ``-m`` if
that gives you what you want when wiring up your view file with Flask-Commands.

A simple way to think about it is:

- ``--route`` controls the route directly
- ``--model`` controls the model name directly
- ``-m`` tells Flask-Commands to generate the model as part of the command flow

Final Comment
-------------

.. youtube_embed:: model-prompts-final-comment

The goal of this section is not simply to avoid prompts. Instead, I wanted to
give you a tool that lets you make a view that includes all the bells
🛎️ and whistles you need so you can wire it up your way.  That way
you could get back to the more interesting part of your application, your
application. Hopefully, after this section on ``make:view``:

- You can feel comfortable typing naturally.
- You can be explicit about how you want your view wired to your back end.
- You can let the package help when the structure is obvious.
- You are prompt-aware, and ready for Flask-Commands to ask about database
  structure so you are not left with a lot of cleanup 🧹 work later.

That is really the sweet spot I wanted for a command like this:

- helpful, but not pushy
- smart, but not mysterious
- willing to do some work for you, but still honest about what is happening

As you can see, there are several ways to avoid the prompt, but they all follow
the same idea: Flask-Commands only asks for more input when the structure is
still ambiguous.

Now let’s put that into practice by building a real resource. We will start
with ``recipes.index``, because it is one of the simplest ways to see the
route, controller, view, and model come together in a single command.
