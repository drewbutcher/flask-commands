Starting a Project
==================

Now that the command is available, let’s create a project. This is where
Flask-Commands starts doing real work for you instead of just sitting there
looking helpful.

Create a Project with ``flask new``
-----------------------------------

.. youtube_embed:: create-a-project-with-flask-new

The fastest way to begin is to scaffold a new project directory and move into
it.  First open a terminal and navigate to where you want the new project.
Then type the following where ``myproject`` is the name of your new project:

.. code-block:: bash

   flask new myproject
   cd myproject

This creates a Flask application scaffold in a new folder called
``myproject``.

What the Default Scaffold Gives You
-----------------------------------

.. youtube_embed:: what-the-default-scaffold-gives-you

By default, ``flask new`` creates a ready-to-run project with database support
and a clear application structure.

The scaffold includes:

- a Python virtual environment
- a Flask application entry point
- configuration files
- routes
- controllers
- templates
- models
- Flask-Migrate wiring
- a default SQLite database setup
- a starter ``run.sh`` script

The entry point is the file Flask uses to start your application. In this
project, that file is ``run.py``.

The goal is not to hide Flask from you. The goal is to give you a clean
starting structure that you can open, read, and build from right away.

Understand the Starter Templates
--------------------------------

.. youtube_embed:: understand-the-starter-templates

A newly generated project includes two templates that work together:

- ``app/templates/base.html`` provides the shared HTML document structure.
- ``app/templates/mains/index.html`` extends that structure to create the
  starter home page.

The base template gives every page one reusable place for shared metadata,
styles, page content, and scripts. Individual pages can then override only
the pieces they need without repeating the entire HTML document.

Create a Project Without a Database
-----------------------------------

.. youtube_embed:: create-a-project-without-a-database

Sometimes you want the Flask structure without the database pieces; this is
where the optional flag ``--no-db`` comes into play.

.. code-block:: bash

   flask new myproject --no-db

This gives you the same general Flask project structure described above
without the database support, models, and migration setup.

That can be useful when:

- you are building a marketing site and not collecting data
- you want to delay database decisions until later
- you know the project does not need persistent data yet
- you have a very specific way of handling data collection and don't want to use MySQL or SQLite

.. _run-the-new-project:

Run the New Project
-------------------

.. youtube_embed:: run-the-new-project

Once the project has been created, the recommended way to launch 🚀 the application
on macOS is:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./run.sh

This little helper script is meant to get you back up and running quickly. It
brings the local development environment online without making you remember
every step by hand.

The ``run.sh`` script performs the following actions:

- activates the project virtual environment
- starts the Flask development server
- opens a Flask shell in a separate terminal
- starts watchers to rebuild both tailwind.css and tailwind.min.css
- opens the project in Visual Studio Code
- launches Chrome and navigates to the running web application

Hot Reloading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Flask handles reloading of your server with ``--debug`` but not reloading of
your web browser. In other words, you would need to refresh your browser
every time you make a change to your application to see the new effect.
However, when you use ``run.sh``, browser reloading is enabled automatically
and watches the following directories:

- templates/
- controllers/
- forms/
- models/
- routes/

Any change made in these folders will **immediately trigger a browser reload**
in Chrome—no manual refresh required. This allows you to edit backend logic,
HTML templates, or forms and see the results instantly.

Please note that ``fswatch`` must be installed on your machine in order for
this to work.  To install ``fswatch`` you can use Homebrew.

Visual Studio Code Setup (macOS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For ``./run.sh`` to open Visual Studio Code automatically, the code command
must be available in your shell.

To enable this in VS Code:

#. Open Visual Studio Code

#. Press Cmd + Shift + P to open the Command Palette

#. Search for and select:

.. code-block:: bash

   Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH

#. Restart your terminal

#. Verify the setup by running the following in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   code .

If Visual Studio Code opens the current directory, the setup is complete.


Use Flask-Commands Inside the New Project
-----------------------------------------

.. youtube_embed:: use-flask-commands-inside-the-new-project

Once you move into the new project and activate its virtual environment, the
``flask`` command will come from that project's local environment.

That is usually exactly what you want when running the application:

.. code-block:: bash

   source venv/bin/activate
   flask run --debug

However, there is one important detail to understand.

Flask-Commands is installed globally so that ``flask new`` works anywhere on
your machine. But once the project virtual environment is active, your shell
uses that environment’s local ``flask`` command instead of the global one.

That means commands like ``flask make:view`` will only work in one of two ways:

Use Flask-Commands from a separate terminal tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the recommended option.

Open a second terminal tab, change into your project directory, and do not
activate the project virtual environment in that tab.

From there, you can run generator commands like:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd myproject
   flask make:view recipes.index -rcm

This uses your global Flask installation with the globally installed
Flask-Commands plugin.

Meanwhile, in your first terminal tab, you can keep the project virtual
environment active and run the application normally:

.. code-block:: bash

   source venv/bin/activate
   flask run --debug

This setup gives you a nice split:

- one terminal tab for running the app
- one terminal tab for generating files

Install Flask-Commands inside the project virtual environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you prefer, you can also install Flask-Commands directly into the project's
virtual environment.

.. code-block:: bash

   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install Flask-Commands

After that, the generator commands will work from inside the project:

.. code-block:: bash

   flask make:view recipes.index -rcm
   flask make:controller RecipeController
   flask make:model Recipe

Both approaches are valid.

The recommended path is to keep Flask-Commands installed globally and use a
separate terminal tab for generator commands. That way you just need to update
one global version of Flask-Commands instead of trying to keep multiple versions
up-to-date (one for every project).

Alternative (Manual Startup)
----------------------------

.. youtube_embed:: alternative-manual-startup

If you prefer to start up manually (not using ``run.sh``), or if you are not
on macOS, the manual startup path is still available through the project
virtual environment and the usual Flask run commands.

.. code-block:: bash

   source venv/bin/activate
   flask run --debug

With the project in place, the next step is understanding the small set of
rules that make the generators feel predictable.
